# IndoorNavCl
Android Client for HS Mainz IndoorNavigation Project

The goal of this scientific project is to attempt to use cheap iBeacons with 
bluetooth low energy technology for indoor positioning and in the future possibly navigation.



The webservice's java code using CXF and Hibernate for DAO operations can be found 
<a href="https://github.com/KekSfabrik/IndoorNavSrv">here</a> and will compile to a runnable jar including jetty.

The "official" site for the project (including the scientific paper once finished) can be found 
<a href="http://i3mainz.hs-mainz.de/de/studentenprojekt/indoor-positionsbestimmung-mit-hilfe-von-ibeacons">here</a>.
