# IndoorNavCl
Android Client for HS Mainz IndoorNavigation Project

The goal of this scientific project is to attempt to use cheap iBeacons with 
bluetooth low energy technology for indoor positioning and in the future possibly navigation.



The webservice's java code using CXF and Hibernate for DAO operations can be found 
<a href="https://github.com/KekSfabrik/IndoorNavSrv">here</a> and will compile to a runnable jar including jetty.

The "official" site for the project (including the scientific paper once finished) can be found 
<a href="http://i3mainz.hs-mainz.de/de/studentenprojekt/indoor-positionsbestimmung-mit-hilfe-von-ibeacons">here</a>.



## This was a student project and the code is no longer going to be maintained
Feel free to do with it as it pleases you - a link to more documentation (probably in german) may be provided at a later
point in time.

Obvious Shortfalls: all the administrative UI things are mostly broken and were just added to show some general direction
where I had hoped this would be going with more free time on my hands.
